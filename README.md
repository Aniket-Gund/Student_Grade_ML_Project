# **📘 Student Performance Prediction – ML Project Overview**

## **Direct Live Link: https://studentgrademlproject-sxowdxn29azwbxywikk8br.streamlit.app/ **

## **🎯 Objective:**

The aim of this Machine Learning project is to predict a student’s final score based on key academic behavior factors such as study hours, attendance, and assignment submission frequency.
The model helps estimate expected performance and provides early indicators for academic improvement.

This ML system can be used for:

Academic performance forecasting

Student counseling and intervention

## **🔍 Key Questions Solved by the ML Model**
1️⃣ How do Hours Studied impact the final score?

Visual / Logic: Regression Relationship
More study hours generally lead to a higher score. The model learns this pattern to make accurate predictions.

2️⃣ Does Attendance contribute significantly to performance?

Visual / Logic: Positive Correlation
Students with higher attendance percentages tend to achieve better results, and the model captures this trend.

3️⃣ Does submitting assignments improve predicted scores?

Visual / Logic: Categorical Influence
Submitting assignments regularly has a clear positive effect on scoring trends in the dataset.

4️⃣ Which features contribute the most to the predicted Score?

Model Behavior:
The model considers multiple factors together:

Hours_Studied → highest linear contribution

Attendance → moderate contribution

Assignments_Submitted → positive additive effect

Together these determine the predicted score.

5️⃣ Can we predict the expected score of any student based on inputs?

Visual: Streamlit UI
Users can input:

Hours Studied

Attendance

Assignments Submitted

Then click “Predict Score” to get their expected performance.

6️⃣ How accurate is the prediction?

Model:
The trained regression model (saved as Student_model.pkl) uses learned relationships from past data to estimate the final score with high precision.

## **📚 Insights Generated by the Model**

The prediction app helps reveal:

Higher study hours → Higher predicted score

High attendance → More stable outcomes

Assignment completion → Strong contributor to final marks

Students with low scores usually have low values across all three predictors
